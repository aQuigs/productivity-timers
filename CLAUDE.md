## Testing Requirements

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) is REQUIRED for all tests:**

1. **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Always follow strict TDD workflow
   - Write a failing test first (Red)
   - Write minimal code to make it pass (Green)
   - Refactor for clarity and efficiency (Refactor)

2. **No Code Without Tests**: All new functionality must have tests written BEFORE implementation

3. **Test First Philosophy**:
   - Define expected behavior in tests before writing implementation
   - Tests serve as executable specifications
   - Implementation should only do what tests require
